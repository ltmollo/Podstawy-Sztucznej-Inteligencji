Ale uwaga - imputacji dokonuje się dopiero po podziale na zbiór treningowy i testowy! W przeciwnym wypadku wykorzystywalibyśmy dane ze zbioru testowego, co sztucznie zawyżyłoby wyniki. Jest to błąd metodologiczny - **wyciek danych (data leakage)**.\n","\n","Podział na zbiór treningowy i testowy to pierwszy moment, kiedy niezbalansowanie danych nam przeszkadza.

Jest to drzewo binarne z decyzjami if-else, prowadzącymi do klasyfikacji danego przykładu w liściu. Każdy podział w drzewie to pytanie postaci \"Czy wartość cechy X jest większa lub równa Y?\". Trening takiego drzewa to prosty algorytm zachłanny, bardzo przypomina budowę zwykłego drzewa binarnego. W każdym węźle wykonujemy:\n","1. Sprawdź po kolei wszystkie możliwe punkty podziału, czyli każdą (unikalną) wartość każdej cechy, po kolei.\n","2. Dla każdego przypadku podziel zbiór na 2 kawałki: niespełniający warunku (lewe dziecko) i spełniający warunek (prawe dziecko).\n","3. Oblicz jakość podziału według pewnej wybranej funkcji jakości. Im lepiej nasz if/else rozdziela klasy od siebie (im \"czystsze\" są węzły-dzieci), tym wyższa jakość. Innymi słowy, chcemy, żeby do jednego dziecka poszła jedna klasa, a do drugiego druga.\n","4. Wybierz podział o najwyższej jakości.\n","\n","Taki algorytm wykonuje się rekurencyjnie, aż otrzymamy węzeł czysty (pure leaf), czyli taki, w którym są przykłady z tylko jednej klasy.

Pomimo tego drzewa potrafią dać bardzo przyzwoite wyniki, a w celu ich poprawy można je regularyzować, aby mieć mniej \"rozrośnięte\" drzewo.

Stwórz klasyfikator złożony poprzez uśrednienie predykcji każdego z klasyfikatorów bazowych.\n","\n","<img src = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Ensemble_Bagging.svg/440px-Ensemble_Bagging.svg.png width = \"440\" height = \"248\" >\n","\n","Typowo klasyfikatory bazowe są bardzo proste, żeby można było szybko wytrenować ich dużą liczbę. Prawie zawsze używa się do tego drzew decyzyjnych. Dla klasyfikacji uśrednienie wyników polega na głosowaniu - dla nowej próbki każdy klasyfikator bazowy ją klasyfikuje, sumuje się głosy na każdą klasę i zwraca najbardziej popularną decyzję.\n","\n","Taki sposób ensemblingu zmniejsza wariancję klasyfikatora. Intuicyjnie, skoro coś uśredniamy, to siłą rzeczy będzie mniej rozrzucone, bo dużo ciężej będzie osiągnąć jakąś skrajność. Redukuje to też overfitting.\n","\n","**Lasy losowe (Random Forests)** to ulepszenie baggingu. Zaobserwowano, że pomimo losowania próbek boostrapowych, w baggingu poszczególne drzewa są do siebie bardzo podobne (są skorelowane), używają podobnych cech ze zbioru. My natomiast chcemy zróżnicowania, żeby mieć niski bias - redukcją wariancji zajmuje się uśrednianie. Dlatego używa się metody losowej podprzestrzeni (random subspace method) - przy każdym podziale drzewa losuje się tylko pewien podzbiór cech, których możemy użyć do tego podziału. Typowo jest to pierwiastek kwadratowy z ogólnej liczby cech.\n","\n","Zarówno bagging, jak i lasy losowe mają dodatkowo bardzo przyjemną własność - są mało czułe na hiperparametry, szczególnie na liczbę drzew. W praktyce wystarczy ustawić 500 czy 1000 drzew i będzie dobrze działać. Dalsze dostrajanie hiperparametrów może jeszcze trochę poprawić wyniki, ale nie tak bardzo, jak przy innych klasyfikatorach. Jest to zatem doskonały wybór domyślny, kiedy nie wiemy, jakiego klasyfikatora użyć.\n","\n","Dodatkowo jest to problem **embarassingly parallel** - drzewa można trenować w 100% równolegle, dzięki czemu jest to dodatkowo wydajna obliczeniowo metoda.\n","\n","Głębsze wytłumaczenie, z interaktywnymi wizualizacjami, można znaleźć [tutaj](https://mlu-explain.github.io/random-forest/).

O ile Random Forest trenował wszystkie klasyfikatory bazowe równolegle i je uśredniał, o tyle boosting robi to sekwencyjnie. Drzewa te uczą się na całym zbiorze, nie na próbkach boostrapowych. Idea jest następująca: trenujemy drzewo decyzyjne, radzi sobie przeciętnie i popełnia błędy na częsci przykładów treningowych. Dokładamy kolejne, ale znające błędy swojego poprzednika, dzięki czemu może to uwzględnić i je poprawić. W związku z tym \"boostuje\" się dzięki wiedzy od poprzednika. Dokładamy kolejne drzewa zgodnie z tą samą zasadą.\n","\n","Jak uczyć się na błędach poprzednika? Jest to pewna **funkcja kosztu** (błędu), którą chcemy zminimalizować. Zakłada się jakąś jej konkretną postać, np. squared error dla regresji, albo logistic loss dla klasyfikacji. Później wykorzystuje się spadek wzdłuż gradientu (gradient descent), aby nauczyć się, w jakim kierunku powinny optymalizować kolejne drzewa, żeby zminimalizować błędy poprzednika. Jest to konkretnie **gradient boosting**, absolutnie najpopularniejsza forma boostingu, i jeden z najpopularniejszych i osiągających najlepsze wyniki algorytmów ML.\n","\n","Tyle co do intuicji. Ogólny algorytm gradient boostingu jest trochę bardziej skomplikowany. Bardzo dobrze i krok po kroku tłumaczy go [ta seria filmów na YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CC4N4z3GJc). Szczególnie ważne implementacje gradient boostingu to **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** oraz **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)**. XGBoost był prawdziwym przełomem w ML, uzyskując doskonałe wyniki i bardzo dobrze się skalując - był wykorzystany w CERNie do wykrywania cząstki Higgsa w zbiorze z pomiarów LHC mającym 10 milionów próbek. Jego implementacja jest dość złożona, ale dobrze tłumaczy ją [inna seria filmików na YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtD8wVaFm6E).\n","\n","![](https://github.com/apohllo/sztuczna-inteligencja/blob/master/lab2/xgboost.png?raw=1)\n","\n","Obecnie najczęściej wykorzystuje się LightGBM. Został stworzony przez Microsoft na podstawie doświadczeń z XGBoostem. Został jeszcze bardziej ulepszony i przyspieszony, ale różnice są głównie implementacyjne. Różnice dobrze tłumaczy [ta prezentacja z konferencji PyData](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CWwwtEM2TA) oraz [prezentacja Microsoftu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nKSMXBFhes).

Typowo im lepszy model, tym bardziej złożony, a najpopularniejsze modele boostingu są z natury skomplikowane. Kiedy mają podejmować krytyczne decyzje, to musimy wiedzieć, czemu predykcja jest taka, a nie inna. Jest to poddziedzina uczenia maszynowego - **wyjaśnialna AI (explainable AI, XAI)**.\n","\n","Taka informacja jest cenna, bo dzięki temu lepiej wiemy, co robi model. Jest to ważne z kilku powodów:\n","1. Wymogi prawne - wdrażanie algorytmów w ekonomii, prawie etc. ma coraz częściej konkretne wymagania prawne co do wyjaśnialności predykcji\n","2. Dodatkowa wiedza dla użytkowników - często dodatkowe obserwacje co do próbek są ciekawe same w sobie i dają wiedzę użytkownikowi (często posiadającemu specjalistyczną wiedzę z dziedziny), czasem nawet bardziej niż sam model predykcyjny\n","3. Analiza modelu - dodatkowa wiedza o wewnętrznym działaniu algorytmu pozwala go lepiej zrozumieć i ulepszyć wyniki, np. przez lepszy preprocessing danych\n","\n","W szczególności można ją podzielić na **globalną** oraz **lokalną interpretowalność (global / local interpretability)**. Ta pierwsza próbuje wyjaśnić, czemu ogólnie model działa tak, jak działa. Analizuje strukturę modelu oraz trendy w jego predykcjach, aby podsumować w prostszy sposób jego tok myślenia. Interpretowalność lokalna z kolei dotyczy predykcji dla konkretnych próbek - czemu dla danego przykładu model podejmuje dla niego taką, a nie inną decyzję o klasyfikacji.\n","\n","W szczególności podstawowym sposobem interpretowalności jest **ważność cech (feature importance)**. Wyznacza ona, jak ważne są poszczególne cechy:\n","- w wariancie globalnym, jak mocno model opiera się na poszczególnych cechach\n","- w wariancie lokalnym, jak mocno konkretne wartości cech wpłynęły na predykcję, i w jaki sposób\n","\n","Teraz będzie nas interesować globalna ważność cech. Dla modeli drzewiastych definiuje się ją bardzo prosto. Każdy podział w drzewie decyzyjnym wykorzystuje jakąś cechę, i redukuje z pomocą podziału funkcję kosztu (np. entropię) o określoną ilość. Dla drzewa decyzyjnego ważność to sumaryczna redukcja entropii, jaką udało się uzyskać za pomocą danej cechy. Dla lasów losowych i boostingu sumujemy te wartości dla wszystkich drzew. Alternatywnie można też użyć liczby splitów, w jakiej została użyta dana cecha, ale jest to mniej standardowe.\n","\n","Warto zauważyć, że taka ważność cech jest **względna**:\n","- nie mówimy, jak bardzo ogólnie ważna jest jakaś cecha, tylko jak bardzo przydatna była dla naszego modelu w celu jego wytrenowania\n","- ważność cech można tylko porównywać ze sobą, np. jedna jest 2 razy ważniejsza od drugiej; nie ma ogólnych progów ważności\n","\n","Ze względu na powyższe, ważności cech normalizuje się często do zakresu [0, 1] dla łatwiejszego porównywania."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1oSkeyJ3R0S0"},"source":["**Zadanie 9 (0.5 punktu)**\n","\n","1.

O ostatecznej decyzji decyduje model, który wykorzystuje te wartości cech. Powstaje pytanie - w jakim stopniu wartości cech przyczyniły się do wyniku swojej drużyny? Można to obliczyć jako wartości Shapleya (Shapley values), które dla modeli ML oblicza algorytm SHAP. Ma on bardzo znaczące, udowodnione matematycznie zalety, a dodatkowo posiada wyjątkowo efektywną implementację dla modeli drzewiastych oraz dobre wizualizacje.\n","\n","Bardzo intuicyjnie, na prostym przykładzie, SHAPa wyjaśnia [pierwsza część tego artykułu](https://iancovert.com/blog/understanding-shap-sage/). Dobrze i dość szczegółówo SHAPa wyjaśnia jego autor [w tym filmie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-taOhqkiuIo)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xg2WSJsPR0S1"},"source":["**Wyjaśnialna AI - podsumowanie**\n","\n","1.

Może się tu przydać klasa `SelectPercentile`. Czy Random Forest i LightGBM (bez dostrajania hiperparametrów, dla uproszczenia) wytrenowane bez najsłabszych cech dają lepszy wynik (AUROC lub innej metryki)?\n","\n","Wykorzystaj po 1 algorytmie z 3 grup algorytmów selekcji cech:\n","1. Filter methods - mierzymy ważność każdej cechy niezależnie, za pomocą pewnej miary (typowo ze statystyki lub teorii informacji), a potem odrzucamy (filtrujemy) te o najniższej ważności. Są to np. `chi2` i `mutual_info_classif` z pakietu `sklearn.feature_selection`.\n","2. Embedded methods - klasyfikator sam zwraca ważność cech, jest jego wbudowaną cechą (stąd nazwa). Jest to w szczególności właściwość wszystkich zespołowych klasyfikatorów drzewiastych. Mają po wytrenowaniu atrybut `feature_importances_`.\n","2. Wrapper methods - algorytmy wykorzystujące w środku używany model (stąd nazwa), mierzące ważność cech za pomocą ich wpływu na jakość klasyfikatora. Jest to np. recursive feature elimination (klasa `RFE`). W tym algorytmie trenujemy klasyfikator na wszystkich cechach, wyrzucamy najsłabszą, trenujemy znowu i tak dalej.\n","\n","Typowo metody filter są najszybsze, ale dają najsłabszy wynik, natomiast metody wrapper są najwolniejsze i dają najlepszy wynik.
